# Agent Instructions — @comet/mail-react

## About this package

[README.md](README.md) explains what this package is, the design decisions behind it (e.g. `useOptionalTheme()` over `useTheme()`), and the conventions its code follows. Read it before working in here. If a change reverses a decision or shifts a convention, update the README in the same PR.

Many subdirectories also have a `README.md` describing the feature that lives there (see the convention in the root README). When you work in a directory, read its README first; if your change makes it inaccurate or adds context worth recording, update it in the same PR.

When your change affects how the package is used (components, behavior, patterns, styling), update the docs and the agent skill (`skills/comet-mail-react/SKILL.md`) — see _Usage documentation_ in the README; consider a separate docs commit. The skill is the agent-facing usage guide; it doesn't restate props, types, or defaults — those live in the package's types and TSDoc.

## When creating a changeset

Before adding a new changeset, check `.changeset/` at the repo root for an existing one covering the same feature (e.g. from an unmerged PR) — update it rather than creating a new file. Only add a new changeset when nothing existing fits.

## Running processes (dev-pm)

This package has two dev-pm scripts (see the `dev-pm` skill for command usage):

| Name                   | What it does                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `mail-react`           | `tsc --watch` — rebuilds `lib/` on change |
| `mail-react-storybook` | `storybook dev -p 6066 --no-open`         |

The `@mail-react` group starts both.

## Storybook

Storybook runs on a fixed port: `http://localhost:6066`.

### Story index API

Storybook exposes a machine-readable index of all stories at `GET /index.json`. Use this to discover stories without globbing the filesystem:

```bash
# List every story as "id — title — name"
curl -s http://localhost:6066/index.json \
  | jq -r '.entries | to_entries[] | "\(.key) — \(.value.title) — \(.value.name)"'

# Find a specific story id by title
curl -s http://localhost:6066/index.json \
  | jq -r '.entries[] | select(.title == "Layout Patterns/Symmetric Two-Column Layout") | .id'
```

### Viewing a story

To visually verify a change, open the isolated story iframe in a browser using the story's `id` from `index.json`:

```
http://localhost:6066/iframe.html?id=<id>&viewMode=story
```

## Scripts

Run these from `packages/mail-react/` (run `nvm use` first).

| Script     | Result                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lint:fix` | Auto-fixes ESLint and Prettier issues in the source                                   |
| `lint`     | Reports all remaining lint, formatting, and TypeScript errors (does not fix anything) |
| `test`     | Runs the Vitest suite once and exits                                                  |

After making changes, run `pnpm run lint:fix` and then `pnpm run lint` to verify. TypeScript errors reported by `lint` must be fixed manually — `lint:fix` does not cover them.
