# Stack

Comet Admin Stack is a component for creating an application with stacked pages allowing the user to navigate between them.
A single page will be displayed at a time.

## Stack Components

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--basic" />
</Canvas>

A stack consists of 3 components: `Stack`, `StackSwitch` and `StackPage`:

### Stack

Root component of the stack.

### StackSwitch

Container for pages where one will render at a time. Similar to a react-router Switch. Provides a context with an API allowing to switch between pages in this `StackSwitch`.

### StackPage

The pages a `StackSwitch` will switch. First one is the default page.

Comet Admin Stack uses react-router behind the scene and creates a `Route` for every page.

## Switch page

### StackLink (Recommended)

Use the `StackLink` component for creating a link to a page.

The StackLink is based on [react-router Link](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link).
It can be combined with the Material UI components [`Link`](https://mui.com/api/link/) and [`Button`](https://mui.com/api/button/) using their `component` prop.
More infos on this functionality can be found in the [Routing Libraries section of the Material UI Docs](https://mui.com/guides/composition/#routing-libraries/).

### activatePage

Alternatively, you can use the `activatePage()` method provided by the `StackSwitchApi` to change the page.
However, it's recommended to use `StackLink` whenever possible because it behaves like a native link.

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        const switchApi = useStackSwitchApi();
        <button
            onClick={(e) => {
                switchApi.activatePage("page2", "test");
            }}
        >
            activate page2
        </button>
  `}
/>

`activatePage(pageName: string, payload: string, subUrl?: string)`

This method will activate (navigate to) the given page.

In case you need the url of a page, it can be obtained by calling `switchApi.getTargetUrl(pageName: string, payload: string, subUrl?: string)`.
This method should only be used if you cannot achieve your goal with a `StackLink` or `activatePage()`.

#### Arguments

| Name       | Type   | Description                                                                      |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pageName\* | string | Name of the page that will be activated.                                         |
| payload\*  | string | Additional payload containing eg. an id that will get passed into the StackPage. |
| subUrl     | string | SubUrl to append, for nested stacks or other nested routes.                      |



## payload

When activating a page (not the default/initial one) you can pass a payload, that can contain eg. an id.
The activated StackPage can access the payload by rendering a function child like so:

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        <StackPage name="example" title="Example">
            {(id) => <div>{id}</div>}
        </Stackpage>
`}
/>

The payload needs to be a string as it is used in the url.

### Example

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--payload" />
</Canvas>

## Nested Stacks

It is possible to nest `StackSwitch`, just render another `StackSwitch` (plus `StackPage`s) in a `StackPage`. You will get automatic Breadcrumbs showing this nesting.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--nested" />
</Canvas>

A nested `Stack` component is usually not desired, as it will have it's own breadcrumbs.

## useStackSwitch

`useStackSwitchApi` accesses the Context created by StackSwitch. For that reason you cannot use it outside of StackSwitch, which also means not in the component where StackSwitch is created.

Comet Admin Stack provides a unique way to create a StackSwitch associated with its api using `useStackSwitch` hook:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--usestackswitch" />
</Canvas>

## Breadcrumbs

The Stack can create automatic Breadcrumbs, which is especially useful for nested stacks.

You have two options:

### `StackBreadcrumbs`, `StackBackButton`

Simple components showing breadcrumbs of the current stack, see Nested Stacks example.

### `ToolbarBreadcrumbs`, `ToolbarBackButton`

Toolbar components that integrate stack nicely into the Comet Toolbar System.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--breadrumbstoolbar" />
</Canvas>

### Custom/Dynamic Breadcrumb Title

Breadcrumbs by default show the title of the `StackPage`. If you want to show something dynamic based on the payload (like the name of the selected item) you can use `StackPageTitle` component:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--dynamictitle" />
</Canvas>

You can also do a graphql query to fetch data needed for creating the title.
