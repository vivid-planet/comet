**The `Table` component has been deprecated in favor of [MUI X Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) in combination with `useDataGridRemote`. View [docs](?path=/story/docs-components-datagrid--page).**

# Sorting

The `Table` component has built-in support for sorting by column.
To use this functionality, you have to follow the following steps:

1.  get an instance of `sortApi` from the `useTableQuerySort()` hook
2.  pass the `sortApi` to the `Table` component
3.  set the property `sortable` to `true` for all columns that you want to sort by
4.  use the values of `sortApi` in your API call

You can then sort the table ascending or descending by column by clicking on the column header.
