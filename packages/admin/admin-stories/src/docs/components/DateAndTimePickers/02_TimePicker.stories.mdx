# Time Picker

To use the `TimePicker` component, install the `@comet/admin-date-time` package.

_**Note**: For usage inside forms built with final-form, use the `FinalFormTimePicker` component._

Similar to the [HTML time input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time), the time value is a 24-hour string in the format `HH:MM`.

By default, there is only one selectable time option every 15 minutes.
This shortens the list of options to reduce the need for scrolling.
Use the `minuteStep` prop to change the step size.

The range of selectable options can be limited by passing a time string into the `min` and `max` props.

## Basic usage

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-time-time-pickers-time-picker--time-picker" />
</Canvas>

## Usage inside a final-form

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-time-time-pickers-time-picker--time-picker-final-form" />
</Canvas>
