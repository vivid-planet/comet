## Storybook

There are two Storybook instances relevant to admin packages:

### `@dextinity/admin` Storybook (package-level)

Located in `admin/.storybook/`. Contains stories specific to the core admin package.

- Stories are located in `admin/src/**/__stories__/*.stories.tsx` and `admin/src/**/*.mdx`
- Runs on port **26646**

```bash
# From packages/admin/admin/
pnpm run storybook

# Build static storybook
pnpm run build-storybook
```

### Root Storybook (repo-level)

Located in `storybook/` at the repo root. Aggregates stories across multiple Dextinity packages and references the `@dextinity/admin` Storybook.

- Runs on port **26638**

```bash
# From storybook/
pnpm run storybook
```

## Tests

All packages use **Vitest** as the test framework.

### Which packages have tests

| Package                      | Test Environment | Setup File      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `@dextinity/admin`           | jsdom            | vitest.setup.ts |
| `@dextinity/admin-rte`       | jsdom            | —               |
| `@dextinity/admin-generator` | node (default)   | —               |
| `@dextinity/cms-admin`       | jsdom            | vitest.setup.ts |

The remaining packages (`admin-babel-preset`, `admin-color-picker`, `admin-date-time`, `admin-icons`, `brevo-admin`) do not have tests.

### Running tests

```bash
# Run tests for a single package (from package directory)
pnpm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test:watch

# Run tests from the repo root
pnpm --filter @dextinity/admin run test
pnpm --filter @dextinity/admin-rte run test
pnpm --filter @dextinity/admin-generator run test
pnpm --filter @dextinity/cms-admin run test

# Update snapshots (admin-generator only)
cd admin-generator && pnpm run test:updateSnapshot
```

### Test conventions

- Test files are co-located with source code, typically in the same directory or a `__tests__/` subdirectory
- File naming: `*.test.ts(x)` or `*.spec.ts(x)`
- Packages testing React components (`admin`, `admin-rte`, `cms-admin`) use the `jsdom` environment and `@testing-library/react`
- `admin-generator` tests use snapshot testing to verify generated output
