# Create a component with theme support

Material-UI supports overriding of styles and default props of components using the theme.  
Using the same method it should also be possible to override all Comet Admin components.

## Example component

_MyComponent: `packages/admin/src/MyComponent.tsx`_

```tsx
import { CometColor } from "@comet/admin-icons";
import { Theme, Typography } from "@material-ui/core";
import { createStyles, WithStyles, withStyles } from "@material-ui/styles";
import clsx from "clsx";
import * as React from "react";

/*
 * The theme-overridable props type should be named after the component, followed by "Props".
 * Make sure the type is also exported in the packages index.ts, it may need to be extended in the application.
 */
export interface MyComponentProps {
    title: React.ReactNode;
    children?: React.ReactNode;
    shadow?: boolean;
}

/*
 * Create a class-key type, which should contain every "class-name" you want to style.
 * It should be named the same as the exported name of the component, followed by "ClassKey".
 *
 * Usually you should create one class for every element that is rendered, e.g. "root", "header", "typography", etc.
 * And one class for every "state" your component could be in, that is usually added to the root-element, e.g. "hasShadow".
 *
 * Make sure the type is also exported in the packages index.ts, it may need to be extended in the application.
 */
export type MyComponentClassKey = "root" | "header" | "typography" | "icon" | "children" | "hasShadow";

/*
 * Create a styles function, using createStyles and make sure to pass in the components ClassKey and Props types.
 */
const styles = (theme: Theme) =>
    createStyles<MyComponentClassKey, MyComponentProps>({
        root: {
            backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.paper,
            "&$hasShadow": {
                boxShadow: "2px 2px 0 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)",
            },
        },
        header: {
            display: "flex",
            alignItems: "center",
            justifyContent: "space-between",
            padding: theme.spacing(4),
        },
        typography: {},
        icon: {},
        children: {
            padding: theme.spacing(4),
        },
        hasShadow: {},
    });

/*
 * Add the `WithStyles<typeof styles>` type to your components props.
 * Then you can access the `classes` prop, to add the styling to the components elements.
 */
function MyComponent({ title, children, shadow, classes }: MyComponentProps & WithStyles<typeof styles>): React.ReactElement {
    return (
        <div className={clsx(classes.root, shadow && classes.hasShadow)}>
            <div className={classes.header}>
                <Typography variant="h1" classes={{ root: classes.typography }}>
                    {title}
                </Typography>
                <CometColor classes={{ root: classes.icon }} />
            </div>
            <div className={classes.children}>{children}</div>
        </div>
    );
}

/*
 * Before exporting your component, wrap it using the withStyles HOC.
 * This will give you access to the classes through the components props.
 *
 * As the name-option, set the components name, prefixed with "CometAdmin".
 * This name will be used to reference the component in props and overrides of your theme.
 */
const MyComponentWithStyles = withStyles(styles, { name: "CometAdminMyComponent" })(MyComponent);

export { MyComponentWithStyles as MyComponent };

/*
 * Add your components Props and ClassKey types to the Material-UI type-definitions.
 */
declare module "@material-ui/core/styles/overrides" {
    interface ComponentNameToClassKey {
        CometAdminMyComponent: MyComponentClassKey;
    }
}

declare module "@material-ui/core/styles/props" {
    interface ComponentsPropsList {
        CometAdminMyComponent: MyComponentProps;
    }
}
```
