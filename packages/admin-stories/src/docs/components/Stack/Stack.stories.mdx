# Stack

Comet Admin Stack is a component for creating an application with stacked pages allowing the user to navigate between them.
A single page will be displayed at a time.

## Stack Components

A stack consists of 3 components

-   `Stack`: root component of the stack
-   `StackSwitch`: Container for pages where one will render at a time. Similar to a react-router Switch. Provides a context with an API allowing to switch between pages in this `StackSwitch`.
-   `StackPage`: The pages a `StackSwitch` will switch. First one is the default page.

Comet Admin Stack uses react-router behind the scene and creates a `Route` for every page.

## Switch page programmatically

### activatePage

To switch between pages use the API provided by `StackSwitch`:

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        const switchApi = useStackSwitchApi();
        <button
            onClick={(e) => {
                switchApi.activatePage("page2", "test");
            }}
        >
            activate page2
        </button>
  `}
/>

`activatePage(pageName: string, payload: string, subUrl?: string)`

This method will activate (navigate to) the given page.

#### Arguments

1. `pageName` (string): name of the page that will be activated
2. `payload` (string): additional payload containing eg. an id that will get passed into the StackPage
3. `subUrl` (string [optional]): subUrl to append, for nested stacks or other nested routes

### StackLink

A StackLink component is planned that will work similarly to react-router Link.

## payload

When activating a page (not the default/initial one) you can pass a payload, that can contain eg. an id.
The activated StackPage can access the payload by rendering a function child like so:

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        <StackPage name="example" title="Example">
            {(id) => <div>{id}</div>}
        </Stackpage
`}
/>

The playload needs to be a string as it is used in the url.

### Example

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--payload" />
</Canvas>

## Nested Stacks

It is possible to nest `StackSwitch`, just render another `StackSwitch` (plus `StackPage`s) in a `StackPage`. You will get automatic Breadcrumbs showing this nesting.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--nested" />
</Canvas>

A nested `Stack` component is usually not desired, as it will have it's own breadcrumbs.

## useStackSwitch

`useStackSwitchApi` accesses the Context created by StackSwitch. For that reason you cannot use it outside of StackSwitch, which also means not in the component where StackSwitch is created.

Comet Admin Stack provides a unique way to create a StackSwitch associated with its api using `useStackSwitch` hook:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--usestackswitch" />
</Canvas>

## Breadcrumbs

The Stack can create automatic Breadcrumbs, which is especially useful for nested stacks.

You have two options:

### `StackBreadcrumbs`, `StackBackButton`

Simple components showing breadcrumbs of the current stack, see Nested Stacks example.

### `ToolbarBreadcrumbs`, `ToolbarBackButton`

Toolbar components that integrate stack nicely into the Comet Toolbar System.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--breadrumbstoolbar" />
</Canvas>

### Custom/Dynamic Breadcrumb Title

Breadcrumbs by default show the title of the `StackPage`. If you want to show something dynamic based on the payload (like the name of the selected item) you can use `StackPageTitle` component:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-stack--dynamictitle" />
</Canvas>

You can also do a graphql query to fetch data needed for creating the title.
