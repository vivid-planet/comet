# Migration Smoke-Test

Run after a major migration finishes (lint/tsc green, all commits pushed) to catch runtime regressions that lint and tsc can't see.

React majors commonly introduce dev-only warnings (DOM-prop leaks, hydration mismatches), Next.js majors break dynamic route resolution silently (async params, percent-encoding), and MUI X majors enforce previously-soft props at runtime. Embedded third-party webcomponents that bundle their own copy of React can also crash against a new React major. None surface in `tsc --noEmit` or eslint.

## Project shape

The dispatching prompt should tell you the project shape — the list of sites with their dev URLs/ports. **Use what's in the prompt; don't re-run discovery `grep`.**

**Sites and the page tree are tied** — both appear together or neither does. Two real shapes:

| Project shape        | Admin pass | Page-tree CRUD | Site pass          |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Admin + 1+ sites     | yes        | yes            | yes, once per site |
| Admin only (0 sites) | yes        | **skip**       | **skip**           |

For multi-site projects, the site pass runs **once per site** — each has its own sitemap and regression surface. A Next.js major can break one site while leaving another working.

If the project is an unusual case (site without page tree, or vice versa), surface that to the user before running.

Note the shape (verbatim from the prompt) at the top of `test-report.md` so the reader knows what was and wasn't covered.

**Fallback if the prompt is missing this info:** scan `package.json` files for `@comet/site-nextjs` and flag the gap in your summary.

```bash
grep -l '"@comet/site-nextjs"' $(find . -name package.json -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.next/*')
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Services running.** `dev-pm status`; admin (8000), api (4000), codegens must be `Running`. Site only matters if `@comet/site-nextjs` exists. Restart any that aren't.
2. **Fixtures loaded.** `npm --prefix api run fixtures` — for projects with a page tree, this seeds the sitemap URLs. Re-run if the migration changed seed/slug logic.
3. **Drive via Playwright MCP** (`browser_*` tools) so console errors are captured. `curl` is fine for HTTP-status sweeps but won't see hydration/DOM-prop errors.
4. **Fresh repo-root `test-report.md` ready to write to.** Append findings as you go.

## Inventory the surface

Skip if the project already has an authoritative inventory file. Otherwise:

- **Admin routes:** read `admin/src/common/MasterMenu.tsx` (or equivalent), list every `path:` entry, group by section.
- **Admin grids/forms:** for each route, identify writable entities (Add/Edit/Delete) — those need a full CRUD pass.
- **Site URL buckets** _(skip if no site package)_: fetch `sitemap.xml` (usually `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml`, but use the port the resolved site listens on — check `dev-pm status`). Parse `<loc>` entries, classify into buckets by URL pattern.

Keep inventory in scratch; don't write to `test-report.md` yet.

## Admin pass

For each admin route:

1. `browser_navigate` to it.
2. `browser_snapshot` to confirm rendering — `<main>` with content vs empty/error fallback.
3. `browser_console_messages level=error` and `level=warning`. Record error/warning counts and one-line excerpts (~120 chars).
4. For writable entities, run CRUD:
    - **Add:** open form, fill required fields with `playwright-smoke-<timestamp>`. Save.
    - **Check the post-save URL** — a literal `undefined`/`null`/`NaN` segment is a regression (e.g. `…/edit/undefined`).
    - **Edit:** change one field, save.
    - **Delete:** remove the record. If no delete control, verify the underlying mutation works via console `fetch('/api/graphql', ...)` before declaring the API broken.
    - If Save fails, capture the error and skip Edit/Delete to avoid half-state.

### Page Tree CRUD is mandatory (on projects with a site)

**Skip on admin-only projects** — page tree presence follows site presence.

Otherwise: the page tree exercises the most upstream code paths (block editor, RTE, file picker, page-tree GraphQL, route-tab navigation). Run a full Add → Edit → Delete on at least one category:

1. Navigate to `/at/pages/pagetree/<category>` (e.g. `main-navigation`).
2. **Add:** click Add, fill Name (slug auto-fills), pick default Document Type, Save. Confirm row appears and URL is clean.
3. **Edit:** open the row's `/edit`. **Walk all tabs** (Blocks, Stage, Seo, Config). The Config tab embeds the RTE and is where React or MUI majors commonly surface prop-leak and `<div>`-in-`<p>` hydration errors. Capture console after each tab switch. Change one trivial field (e.g. `Menu description`), Save, reload, verify the value persisted.
4. **Delete:** context menu → Delete → confirm. Verify row is gone.

If any step fails, that's a blocker for the PR.

After the run, delete any test records (or note them in `test-report.md`).

### Two errors to expect everywhere

Many projects have one or two errors that fire on _every_ admin page (Sentry init, logo SVG, etc.). Identify these once and call them "baseline" — count per-route errors _above_ baseline rather than reporting baseline N times.

## Site pass

**Skip this section entirely if no `@comet/site-nextjs` package.** Note "no site package, site pass skipped" in `test-report.md` and stop here.

**For multi-site projects, run once per site.** Each has its own sitemap, routes, and regression surface. Sites typically expose themselves:

- Different ports on `localhost` (3000, 3001, …) — check `dev-pm status`.
- Different hostnames via project middleware (`site/src/middleware.ts`) — hit with `Host:` header override or per-site dev URL.

Write per-site results under their own subheading (e.g. `### Site: <site-name> (port 3001)`).

1. Fetch `sitemap.xml`, parse `<loc>` entries.
2. **Bucket URLs** by pattern (locale-prefixed, fixture/scaffold, normal pages, ...). Some buckets need sampling; small ones can be exhausted.
3. **Pick a seeded sample.** Common shape: 20 normal + all of any small bucket the user cares about. Use a deterministic shuffle for reproducible runs.
4. For each picked URL: navigate, snapshot, collect errors/warnings.
5. For high-volume buckets, **bulk-fetch HTTP status first**: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"` catches blanket 404s in seconds. Browser-walk 200s plus a handful of 404s to see the error page.
6. **Bytes-check sitemap URLs with special characters.** If a `<loc>` contains `:`, `?`, `#`, `&`, or other RFC 3986 sub-delims, verify it resolves. Use `od -c` to confirm a colon is real, not a `&#58;` artifact.

### Embedded webcomponents (high-risk)

If the site embeds third-party **webcomponents** / micro-frontends — a block that loads an external `<script>` mounting a widget owned by another team (forms, product sliders, search or booking widgets, etc.) — treat every page that renders one as high-risk and test each webcomponent **individually in the browser**.

Webcomponents that bundle their own copy of React (and related libraries) can crash at runtime against a new React major while lint, `tsc`, and the build all pass — often with a cryptic minified error deep inside React. The migration guide documents any known per-version failure mode and workaround; apply that if present.

1. **Detect:** `grep -rnE "customElements|next/script|<script" site/src`, plus any block whose job is to embed an external widget.
2. **Browser-test each webcomponent type** (not just each page): navigate to a page that renders it, confirm it actually **mounts and is interactive** — a 200 status or a rendered page shell is not enough — and capture console errors.
3. A crash here is a **production blocker**, not a warning.
4. Call out every webcomponent and its result explicitly in `test-report.md`, and tell the user to verify each one on staging **before deploying to production**.

### Side effect of 404s

Any URL that falls through to not-found produces _additional_ errors from the not-found page itself (`<a>` nested in `<a>`, hydration mismatch). Don't count these against the per-URL budget — they're a single not-found bug surfacing N times.

## Triage findings

Apply one of three labels _while_ walking, not after:

1. **Project-fixable** — broken code is under `admin/src`, `site/src`, `api/src`. Belongs in the migration PR or a follow-up.
2. **Comet upstream** — broken code is under `node_modules/@comet/*`. Surface to the user; don't workaround.
3. **Pre-existing / out-of-scope** — same warning pre-existed migration (font preload, Swiper loop, etc.). Note once at the bottom; don't itemize per-route.

If you can't tell which bucket, grep for the symbol in the project source — if absent, it's upstream or a transitive dep.

## Output: `test-report.md`

Write findings to `test-report.md` at the repo root as you go. The file is the deliverable.

```markdown
# Smoke-test findings — <date>

Tool: Playwright MCP (Chromium). Branch: `<branch>`.
Project shape: <admin + 1+ sites | admin-only>.
Sites detected: <none | list of site dirs + dev URLs>.
Scope: <admin route count> admin routes; per site, <URL count> sampled from <total>.

## TL;DR — biggest problems first

<5–8 numbered bullets, ordered by user impact, each with file path or error excerpt>

## Session-global console errors (every admin page)

<the 0–2 baseline errors, called out once>

## Admin

### <route>

- **Screen**: clean | "<visible error>"
- **Console**: <n> errors, <m> warnings (above baseline)
    - <one-line excerpt of each>
- **CRUD** (if applicable): create/edit/delete: ok | failed (<why>)

## Sites

(One block per site. Skip the section entirely for admin-only.)

### Site: <site-name> (<dev-url>)

#### Sampling

- Sitemap total: <n> URLs in <bucket-count> buckets.
- Sample: <breakdown by bucket>.

#### Per-URL results

<grouped by error class, e.g. "0 errors", "1 error — Received false for non-boolean attribute active">

## Hand off to Comet upstream

<numbered list of upstream bugs with @comet/\* module paths>

## Numbers

- Admin routes visited: <n>. Broken: <n>. With extra console errors: <n>.
- Site URLs sampled: <n total>. HTTP 200: <n>. HTTP 404: <n>.

## Cleanup

- Test records left in DB: <list or "none">.
```

Avoid one heading per URL when most look the same — group by failure mode. Five URLs with the same `active={false}` warning are one finding with five examples.

## Re-verify after fixes

After the engineer fixes project-fixable findings:

1. **Re-run failing scenarios in the browser** — not just the unit test. Green `tsc` doesn't tell you if the URL resolves.
2. **For each "Fixed" item**: load a previously-broken URL, capture console, confirm the specific error string is gone. A different error could have replaced it.
3. **Re-run fixtures if the migration changed seed/slug logic** before re-checking site URLs.
4. **Bytes-check the sitemap** for previously-broken patterns (use `od -c`, not just `grep`).
5. **Update `test-report.md`** with a "Fixed in this branch" section. Keep upstream/out-of-scope findings in place.

Useful pattern: ask "commit each fix atomically?" before starting — answer is almost always yes — and re-run the smoke test after to confirm hooks didn't revert anything.

## When to stop and ask the human

- **Hundreds of URLs in a bucket all 404.** Route-group regression, not N bugs. Stop after the first 5–10 confirm the pattern.
- **A console error mentions a file you can't locate** under `src/` or `node_modules/@comet/*`. Ask, don't guess.
- **CRUD test fails with a 500 suggesting data corruption** (FK violation, dangling reference). Stop before continuing; test data may be polluting subsequent runs.
- **Playwright MCP can't reach the dev server** (timeouts, ECONNREFUSED). Check `dev-pm status`; if everything is `Running` but unreachable, surface the discrepancy before random restart commands.
