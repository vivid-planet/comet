# Form Validation

Form validation can be done in two ways, either for the whole form (record-level), or for a single filed (field-level).

> For more information regarding validation, please review the React Final Form documentation on [record-level validation](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FormProps#validate) and [field-level validation](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldProps#validate).

### Record-level validation

<Canvas of={ValidationStories.RecordLevelValidation} />

> Use the special key `FORM_ERROR` to display a validation error concerning the whole form.

### Field-level validation

<Canvas of={ValidationStories.FieldLevelValidation} />

### Warnings

In addition to error validation, Comet Admin also supports warnings for the `FinalForm` and `Field` components. This can be done by using the `validateWarning` props, which offer the same functionality as the React Final Form `validate` props.

> Please note that a warning _does not_ mark the form as `invalid`, and therefore _does not_ prevent the form from being submitted. If you wish to achieve this, use error validation instead.
