## Localization

For localization of the DatePicker, it needs to be wrapped by `DateFnsLocaleProvider` with the desired locale. <br />
Generally, this is done at the entry point of the application, e.g., in `App.tsx`:

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        import { en as dateFnsEnLocale } from "date-fns/locale";
        import { DateFnsLocaleProvider } from "@comet/admin-date-time";
        export const MyApp = () => (
            <DateFnsLocaleProvider value={dateFnsEnLocale}>
                {/* App content */}
            </DateFnsLocaleProvider>
        );
    `}
/>
