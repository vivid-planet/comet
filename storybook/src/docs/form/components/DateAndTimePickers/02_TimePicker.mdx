# Time Picker

To use the `TimePicker` and `FinalFormTimePicker` components, install the `@comet/admin-date-time` package.

By default, there is only one selectable time option every 15 minutes. <br />
This shortens the list of options to reduce the need for scrolling. <br />
Use the `minuteStep` prop to change the step size.

The range of selectable options can be limited by passing a time string (formatted as `HH:MM`) into the `min` and `max` props.

## Value type

The `value` prop and the value returned by `onChange` are 24-hour strings formatted as `HH:MM`, similar to the [HTML time input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time).

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={TimePickerStories.Basic} />

## Usage inside a Final Form

<Canvas of={TimePickerStories.FinalForm} />
