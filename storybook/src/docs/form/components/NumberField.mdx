# Number Field

The NumberField can be used for number inputs. It automatically formats the numbers with thousand-separators and decimal symbols in the current locale. You can also use it for currency inputs by passing the currency symbol as `startAdornment` or `endAdornment`. The value is stored as type `number` in the form values.

## Basic usage
