# FieldContainer

`FieldContainer` is used to contain an input and provide basic styling/layout within the form.  
It is also used to set a label, error--messages and other common form-field attributes.

_Note: If your form is built with final-form, use [Field](?path=/docs/docs-form-components-field--docs) instead._
