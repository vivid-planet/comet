# Form Overview

Forms enable users to submit information to a web application. Therefore, forms belong to the essential features of every admin application.

In Comet Admin, React Final Form (RFF) is used for building forms. You can find more information on this framework in the [React Final Form Docs](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/getting-started).

## When (not) to use Final Form

Final Form is strongly recommended if you

-   are building an extensive or complicated form
-   want to submit the form data to an API

However, Final Form might not be sensible for every use case.
Final Form may be needlessly complex if you want to create a solitary input field (e.g., a single select field for client-side filtering).
In this case, you can use a plain input component combined with a React state.

## Validation

For information on how to validate your form, visit the [Validation page](?path=/docs/docs-form-validation--docs).

## Layout

For information on implementing different layout types in your form, visit the [Layout page](?path=/docs/docs-form-layout--docs).

## Components

### FinalForm

Comet Admin provides a `FinalForm` component.
It's built on top of [React Final Form's `Form` component](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/Form).

You can find more information on the [FinalForm component page](?path=/docs/docs-form-components-finalform--docs).

### FieldContainer

Use `FieldContainer` to wrap inputs in non-Final-Form forms.
It provides a basic layout, a label and can handle error states.

You can find more information on the [FieldContainer page](?path=/docs/docs-form-components-fieldcontainer--docs).

### Field

Use `Field` for inputs within a FinalForm form.

You can find more information on the [Field page](?path=/docs/docs-form-components-field--docs).

### FormSection

`FormSection` can be used to separate a form into smaller groups of related inputs.
This gives the form structure and makes it easier to comprehend.

You can find more information on the [FormSection page](?path=/docs/docs-form-components-formsection--docs).
