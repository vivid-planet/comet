**The `Table` component has been deprecated in favor of [MUI X Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) in combination with `useDataGridRemote`. View [docs](?path=/story/docs-components-datagrid--page).**

# TableDndOrder

`TableDndOrder` is a special version of the `Table`.
It supports changing the order of table rows via drag and drop.

`TableDndOrder` has all props of `Table`.
Additionally, there is a `onDragEnd()` prop that can be used to implement an automatic submit after a row has been moved.
And a `moveRow()` prop for implementing the reordering after a row has been moved.

For most use cases, you can wrap the `TableDndOrder` in a `TableLocalChanges` component.
`TableLocalChanges` provides a built-in `moveRow()` function for simple reordering (amongst other convenience functions).
You can see it in action in the example below.
