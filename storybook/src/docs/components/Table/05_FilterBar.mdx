# Filterbar

Often the user wants to filter the data in a `Table`.
To implement various filters, stick to the following steps:

1. get a `filterApi` instance from the `useTableQueryFilter()` hook
2. add a `TableFilterFinalForm` component and pass the `filterApi`
3. add a `FilterBar` component inside the `TableFilterFinalForm`
4. add filters to the `FilterBar`. A filter typically consists of a `FilterBarPopoverFilter` with one or multiple `Field`s
5. use the values of `filterApi` for filtering. Typically, this will happen by passing them as variables to a GraphQL query (in the following example, filtering is done on the client-side for simplicity reasons)

## Filterbar and Persisted State

Oftentimes every item in a table can be viewed or edited individually.
If the user navigates to a detail page or form and later returns to the table page, all the filters are gone.

To prevent this behaviour, you can pass a `persistedStateId` to the `useTableQueryFilter()` hook.
Then, the filters are saved in a global variable once the user leaves the table page.
When the user returns, the filters are recovered from the global variable.
