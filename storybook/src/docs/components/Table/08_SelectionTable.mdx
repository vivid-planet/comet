**The `Table` component has been deprecated in favor of [MUI X Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) in combination with `useDataGridRemote`. View [docs](?path=/docs/docs-components-datagrid--docs).**

# Selection Table

The `Table` component has a built-in [selection](?path=/docs/docs-components-selection--docs) functionality.
That can, for example, be used to create a table with an adjacent form.
The user can select an item from the table and edit it in the form.

To use this functionality, follow these steps:

1. get an instance of `selection` and `selectionApi` from a selection hook ([useSelection()](?path=/docs/docs-components-selection--docs#useselection-hook-recommended) or [useSelectionRoute()](?path=/docs/docs-components-selection--docs#useselectionroute-hook-recommended))
2. (only for `useSelectionRoute()`) wrap `Table` and form in the `SelectionRoute`
3. set the `selectable` prop to `true` and pass `selectedId` and `selectionApi` to the `Table`
4. use the `Selected` component to access the currently selected item. Pass the item to your form
