# Table

> Tables display information in a way that's easy to scan, so that users can look for patterns and insights.

The Comet Admin `Table` internally uses [Material UI's `Table` component](https://v4.mui.com/components/tables/) and its [associated components](https://v4.mui.com/components/tables/#api).
It provides an additional layer of abstraction and adds common table functionalities like [sorting by column](?path=/docs/docs-components-table-sorting--docs) or [pagination](?path=/docs/docs-components-table-pagination--docs).

In the following text, `Table` refers to the Comet Admin Table, while `MuiTable` refers to Material UI's Table.

## Differences between Comet Admin `Table` and `MuiTable`

`MuiTable` is very low-level.
It's extremely flexible but requires more effort to define and configure.
If you need common table functionalities like pagination or sorting, you have to implement them yourself from scratch.

Comet Admin `Table` adds a layer of abstraction to `MuiTable`.
It allows you to define simple tables without writing any additional JSX and also has a lot of configuration options for more complex use cases.
Additionally, it has common table functionalities built-in, as listed below:

| [Excel Export](?path=/docs/docs-components-table-excel-export--docs)                     | -                   | built-in            |
| [Ordering Rows via Drag and Drop](?path=/docs/docs-components-table-tabledndorder--docs) | -                   | built-in            |

The following example shows the definition of a simple table with `MuiTable` and Comet Admin `Table`.
It demonstrates their different layers of abstraction.

With `MuiTable`, you have to write a lot of JSX to define this simple table:

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        // based on https://v4.mui.com/components/tables/#BasicTable.tsx
        <MuiTable>
            <MuiTableHead>
                <MuiTableRow>
                    <MuiTableCell>Dessert (100g)</MuiTableCell>
                    <MuiTableCell>Calories</MuiTableCell>
                </MuiTableRow>
            </MuiTableHead>
            <MuiTableBody>
                {rows.map((row) => (
                    <MuiTableRow key={row.name}>
                        <MuiTableCell>{row.name}</MuiTableCell>
                        <MuiTableCell>{row.calories}</MuiTableCell>
                    </MuiTableRow>
                ))}
            </MuiTableBody>
        </MuiTable>
  `}
/>

In Comet Admin `Table`, it's sufficient to provide an object containing column definitions:

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        <Table
            data={rows}
            totalCount={rows.length}
            columns={[
                {
                    name: "name",
                    header: "Dessert (100g)"
                },
                {
                    name: "calories",
                    header: "Calories"
                }
            ]}
        />
  `}
/>

However, Comet Admin `Table` is not limited to simple tables.
It has lots of configuration options to handle complex use cases.
Keep reading to learn more.

## Table

<Canvas of={BasicsStories.BasicTable} />

`Table` has three required parameters: `data`, `totalCount` and `columns`.

`data` contains the data that should be displayed in the table. It must be an array of objects, and each object must have a unique `id`.

`totalCount` specifies the total number of items.
It's only relevant if pagination is used. Then, the totalCount should be provided by the API.
If **no pagination** is used, `totalCount` can simply be set to `data.length`.

`columns` is an array that defines the structure of the table.
It specifies which columns exist and how to render them.
More information can be found in the [column section](#table-column).

## Table Column

### name

The only required property of a column is its `name`.
Per default, the `name` is matched to a property of `data`, which is then rendered:

<Canvas of={BasicsStories.TableColumnNameProp} />

Matching also works for nested properties if the `name` is separated by dots:

<Canvas of={BasicsStories.TableColumnNestedNameProp} />

### render

Passing a function to the `render` prop overrides the default rendering behavior.
The render function can be used for altering the styling of a column or for rendering columns that don't have a corresponding prop in `data`:

<Canvas of={BasicsStories.TableColumnRenderProp} />

### header

The `header` property defines the heading of a column.
It can be a string or a JSX element.

If no header is set, the heading of a column is empty.

<Canvas of={BasicsStories.TableColumnHeaderProp} />

### visible

`visible` can be used to hide a column.

<Canvas of={BasicsStories.TableColumnVisibleProp} />

### cellProps & headerProps

Internally, the `Table` uses Material UI's `TableCell` to render table headers and cells.
`cellProps` and `headerProps` can be used to pass props to these internal elements.
You can find more information in the [Material UI Docs](https://v4.mui.com/api/table-cell/).

### sortable

The `sortable` property can be used for sorting the table.
See [Sorting page](?path=/docs/docs-components-table-sorting--docs) for more information.

### headerExcel & renderExcel & formatForExcel

These properties can be used for formatting the table data when exporting it to an Excel file.
See [Excel Export page](?path=/docs/docs-components-table-excel-export--docs#excel-export-and-custom-rendered-columns) for more information.
