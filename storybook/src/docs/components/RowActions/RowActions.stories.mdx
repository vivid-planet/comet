# RowActions system

The RowActions system is a set of components used to create IconButtons with menus that can contain nested sub-menus and action items. <br />
Common use cases include context menus and quick-action IconButtons in table rows and other listed items.

The RowActions system consists of `RowActionsMenu` & `RowActionsItem`.

-   `RowActionsMenu` is used to contain both `RowActionsItem` and more nested `RowActionsMenu` components.
-   `RowActionsItem` is used as a button to trigger an action.

Menus can be infinitely nested to create sub-menus.

Menus & items inside the outermost menu are displayed as an IconButton. <br />
When nested within multiple menus, they are rendered as a ListItem inside a Menu.
