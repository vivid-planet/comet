# Selection

In Comet Admin, a _selection_ can be used to manage which item of a list or table a user has currently selected.

The two most common use cases for selections are

- creating and editing items in a dialog.
  Comet Admin has a dedicated `EditDialog` component that uses selection internally.
  You can find more infos in the [EditDialog docs](?path=/docs/docs-components-edit-dialog--docs#editdialog-and-table).

- selecting items from a table to edit them in an adjacent form.
  An example can be found in the [Selection Table docs](?path=/docs/docs-components-table-selection-table--docs).

## Selection (without URL State)

You can either use the `useSelection()` hook or the `Selection` component to implement a selection.

### useSelection() Hook (Recommended)

The `useSelection()` hook returns an array containing two objects.
The first object contains two values:

- `id` holds the id of the currently selected item.
- `mode` specifies the goal of the selection. Either `add` (add a new item) or `edit` (edit an existing item).

The second object is the [Selection API](#selection-api).

### Selection Component

The `Selection` component passes its values to its children via child function.

It provides the same values as `useSelection()`, but the variable names are slightly different:

- `selectedId` instead of `id`
- `selectionMode` instead of `mode`
- `selectionApi` contains the [Selection API](#selection-api)

## Selection with URL State

In practice, a common requirement is that each item should have a unique URL.
For that purpose, the id of the currently selected item has to be written to the URL path.
Comet Admin has this functionality built-in.

To implement a selection with URL state, you can use the `useSelectionRoute()` hook or the `SelectionRoute` component.

### useSelectionRoute() Hook (Recommended)

The `useSelectionRoute()` hook is similar to `useSelection()`.
The main difference is that it returns three objects instead of two.

The first - and additional - object is now a `SelectionRoute`.
This `SelectionRoute` must wrap the selection-specific part of your application for the routing to function correctly.

### SelectionRoute Component

The `SelectionRoute` is the URL-stateful equivalent of the `Selection` component.
You can use it exactly like `Selection` since it provides the same values.

## Selection API

The Selection API provides three functions to select and deselect items:

- `handleSelectId()` for selecting an existing item
- `handleAdd()` for "selecting" a new item. It accepts an optional `id` parameter if you generate the new id on the client-side.
- `handleDeselect()` for deselection
