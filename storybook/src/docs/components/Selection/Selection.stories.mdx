# Selection

In Comet Admin, a _selection_ can be used to manage which item of a list or table a user has currently selected.

The two most common use cases for selections are

-   creating and editing items in a dialog.
    Comet Admin has a dedicated `EditDialog` component that uses selection internally.
    You can find more infos in the [EditDialog docs](/story/docs-components-edit-dialog--page#editdialog-and-table).

-   selecting items from a table to edit them in an adjacent form.
    An example can be found in the [Selection Table docs](/story/docs-components-table-selection-table--page).

## Selection (without URL State)

You can either use the `useSelection()` hook or the `Selection` component to implement a selection.

### useSelection() Hook (Recommended)

The `useSelection()` hook returns an array containing two objects.
The first object contains two values:

-   `id` holds the id of the currently selected item.
-   `mode` specifies the goal of the selection. Either `add` (add a new item) or `edit` (edit an existing item).

The second object is the [Selection API](#selection-api).

### Selection Component

The `Selection` component passes its values to its children via child function.

It provides the same values as `useSelection()`, but the variable names are slightly different:

-   `selectedId` instead of `id`
-   `selectionMode` instead of `mode`
-   `selectionApi` contains the [Selection API](#selection-api)

    <Story id="stories-components-selection-selection-component--selection-component" />
</Canvas>

## Selection with URL State

In practice, a common requirement is that each item should have a unique URL.
For that purpose, the id of the currently selected item has to be written to the URL path.
Comet Admin has this functionality built-in.

To implement a selection with URL state, you can use the `useSelectionRoute()` hook or the `SelectionRoute` component.

### useSelectionRoute() Hook (Recommended)

The `useSelectionRoute()` hook is similar to `useSelection()`.
The main difference is that it returns three objects instead of two.

The first - and additional - object is now a `SelectionRoute`.
This `SelectionRoute` must wrap the selection-specific part of your application for the routing to function correctly.

</Canvas>

### SelectionRoute Component

The `SelectionRoute` is the URL-stateful equivalent of the `Selection` component.
You can use it exactly like `Selection` since it provides the same values.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-selection-selectionroute-component--selectionroute-component" />
</Canvas>

## Selection API

The Selection API provides three functions to select and deselect items:

-   `handleSelectId()` for selecting an existing item
-   `handleAdd()` for "selecting" a new item. It accepts an optional `id` parameter if you generate the new id on the client-side.
-   `handleDeselect()` for deselection
