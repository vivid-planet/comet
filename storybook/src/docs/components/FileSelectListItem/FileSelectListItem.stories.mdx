# FileSelectListItem

Used to display a list of files, including loading, skeleton, and error states and options to download and delete the file.

## Usage

-   Use the `skeleton` prop if you do not have any data for the file.
-   Use the `loading` prop if the file's data is being fetched or uploaded, but the filename is already available.
-   Use the `name` and `size` props to display the file name and size.
-   Use the `onDownload` and `onDelete` props to handle what happens when clicking the download and delete buttons.
-   Use the `error` prop as a boolean to set the error state or as a string to display an error message.
