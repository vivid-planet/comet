# FileSelectListItem

Used to display a list of files, including loading, skeleton, and error states and options to download and delete the file.

## Usage

- Pass a `file` prop to display the file.
    - The file will be rendered normally if `name` and optionally `size` are provided.
    - If the `loading` value is `true` and `name` is provided, the file will be rendered in a loading state.
    - If the `loading` value is `true` and no `name` is provided, the file will be rendered as a skeleton.
    - The file will be rendered in an error state if the `error` value is `true` or a string with an error message is provided.
- Use the `downloadUrl`, `onClickDownload` and `onClickDelete` props to handle what happens when clicking the download and delete buttons.
- Set the `filePreview` prop to `true` or pass in a image url to display the item as a card with a preview.
