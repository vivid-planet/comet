# FileSelect

Used to combine `FileDropzone` and `FileSelectListItem` to handle the user's selection of files, displaying those files below, and handling the download and remove actions.

## Usage

- Use props from [react-dropzone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropzone), such as `onDrop`, to handle what happens when selecting files.
- Use the `files` prop to pass in the list of files that should be shown.
- Use the `getDownloadUrl`, `onDownload` and `onRemove` props to handle what happens when clicking the download and remove buttons.
- Set the `layout` prop to `grid` to display the files as a grid of cards with a file preview.
- Limit the amount of files and the size of the individual files with the `maxFiles` and `maxFileSize` props.
