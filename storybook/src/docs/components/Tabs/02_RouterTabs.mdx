# Router Tabs

The Comet Admin `RouterTabs` component has essentially the same functionality as `Tabs`.
However, `RouterTabs` manages its state in the URL so that each tab has a unique URL.

`RouterTabs` has the following props:

- `tabComponent` for passing a custom tab component. Per default, [Material UI's `Tab` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tab/) is used
- `tabsProps` for passing props to [Material UI's `Tabs` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tabs/)

As children, an array of `RouterTab` elements should be passed to `RouterTabs`.
Each `RouterTab` needs:

- a `label` that is shown in the tab bar
- a unique `path` of the tab that is attached to the URL
- optionally a `forceRender` flag ([see Tabs docs for examples](?path=/docs/docs-components-tabs-tabs--docs#tabs-and-forcerender))

## RouterTabs and Nested Stack

When used on a nested `StackPage`, `RouterTabs` automatically hides other `RouterTabs` on higher levels.
In this way, only the `RouterTabs` on the current level are shown.
That ensures that the UI doesn't appear cluttered with tabs.
