# Tabs

> Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

The Comet Admin `Tabs` are based on [Material UI's `Tabs`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tabs/) (`MuiTabs`).

`Tabs` has the following props:

- `tabComponent` for passing a custom tab component.
  Per default, [Material UI's `Tab` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tab/) is used
- `defaultIndex` for setting the initially active tab
- `tabsState` can be used to pass a custom state object.
  It replaces the internal state, keeping track of the active tab

As children, an array of `Tab` elements should be passed to `Tabs`.
`Tab` has following props:

- a `label` that is shown in the tab bar
- optionally a [forceRender flag](#tabs-and-forcerender)

## Tabs and forceRender

Tabs has a prop called `forceRender`.
The default value is `false`, meaning the content is only rendered if the tab is active.
If set to `true`, the tab content is always rendered but hidden via CSS while the tab is not active.

There are two main use cases for the forceRender prop:

1. You want to preserve the state of components inside a tab.

In React, components are unmounted once they are not rendered anymore.
On unmount, the components lose their state.
With `forceRender` this unmount is prevented.

**Example:** You have implemented tabs.
One tab contains a form.
You don't want to lose the form content if the user switches the tab.

❌ Without `forceRender` the form content is lost after a tab switch

<Canvas of={TabsStories.FormInTabsWithoutForceRender} />

✅ With `forceRender` the form content is preserved

<Canvas of={TabsStories.FormInTabsWithForceRender} />

2. You implement a form whose fields are distributed over multiple tabs.

React Final Form "forgets" that fields exist once they are unmounted.
Therefore, the form is not marked as dirty anymore as soon as you switch to a tab containing only empty fields.

❌ Without `forceRender` the form is marked as pristine after switching from `Tab 1` to `Tab 2`.
This means that the user can't save their progress and can leave the page without getting a "Discard unsaved changes" dialog.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.TabsInFormWithoutForceRender} />

✅ With `forceRender` the fields stay mounted and the form is correctly marked as dirty after a tab switch.
Saving is possible.

## Differences between Comet Admin `Tabs` and `MuiTabs`

Like all Material UI components, `MuiTabs` is relatively low-level.
It's very flexible but has no built-in functionality.
Comet Admin enhances the `MuiTabs` by adding built-in functionality.
Therefore, using Comet Admin `Tabs` is considerably easier and faster.

The following example shows the definition of simple tabs with `MuiTabs` and Comet Admin `Tabs`.

With `MuiTabs`, you have to manage the state yourself (`value`) and ensure that only the current tab's content is rendered.
You can use `MuiTabs` and `MuiTab` only for creating the tab labels.
The tab content has to be defined separately.

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        // based on https://v4.mui.com/components/tabs/#SimpleTabs.tsx
        const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
        const handleChange = (event: ChangeEvent<{}>, newValue: number) => {
            setValue(newValue);
        };
        return (
            <div>
                <MuiAppBar>
                    <MuiTabs value={value} onChange={handleChange}>
                        <MuiTab label="Label One" />
                        <MuiTab label="Label Two" />
                        <MuiTab label="Label Three" />
                    </MuiTabs>
                </MuiAppBar>
                <div hidden={value !== 0}>
                    {value === 0 && (
                        Content One
                    )}
                </div>
                <div hidden={value !== 1}>
                    {value === 1 && (
                        Content Two
                    )}
                </div>
                <div hidden={value !== 2}>
                    {value === 2 && (
                        Content Three
                    )}
                </div>
            </div>
        );
`}
/>

With Comet Admin `Tabs`, the state management and rendering logic are built-in.
And you can simply pass the tab content as child to the `Tab` component.

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        <Tabs>
            <Tab label="Label One">
                Content One
            </Tab>
            <Tab label="Label Two">
                Content Two
            </Tab>
            <Tab label="Label Three">
                Content Three
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
`}
/>
