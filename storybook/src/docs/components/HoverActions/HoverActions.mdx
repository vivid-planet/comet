# HoverActions

Used to show actions when hovering over some content.  
For example, a `CopyToClipboardButton` inside a table cell.

_Note: `HoverActions` uses absolute positioning to show the actions when hovering above the parent.  
This may require setting `position: relative` to the parent to prevent overlaying other content._
