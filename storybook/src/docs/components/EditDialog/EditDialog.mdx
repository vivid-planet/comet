# Edit Dialog

An EditDialog typically includes a form that allows users to add or edit a resource.
It's commonly used in combination with a table to add new rows or edit existing rows.

## EditDialog

There are two ways to integrate an EditDialog.

### 1) useEditDialog Hook (Recommended)

The recommended way is to use the `useEditDialog` hook.
It returns an instance of `EditDialog` and the corresponding `editDialogApi`.

<Canvas of={EditDialogStories.Hook} />

### 2) EditDialog Component

Alternatively, you can import the `EditDialog` component from `@comet/admin` and use it directly.
To gain access to the `editDialogApi`, you need to attach a ref to the component.

<Canvas of={EditDialogStories.Component} />

## useEditDialogApi and EditDialogApiContext

You can access the `editDialogApi` using the `useEditDialogApi` hook.
As a prerequisite, you need to pass the `editDialogApi` to the `EditDialogApiContext.Provider` somewhere higher up
in the component tree.

<Canvas of={EditDialogStories.UseEditDialogApi} />

## Form in EditDialog

The `EditDialog` typically contains a form for editing a resource.
When submitting the changes to an API via GraphQL mutation, the loading and error states are displayed automatically by the `SaveButton`.

## EditDialog and Table

The most common use case for an EditDialog is for editing single rows in a table.

## EditDialog and Selection API

Internally, the EditDialog uses the [selection](?path=/docs/docs-components-selection--docs) API to handle its current state.
The selection has two properties: `id` and `mode`.

### Modes

The EditDialog supports two modes: `add` and `edit`.

If a new resource is added, `mode` is set to `add` and `id` is set to `undefined`.
The mode is also appended to the URL (`/add`).

If an existing resource is changed, `mode` is set to `edit`.
The `id` then specifies which resource is edited and is appended to the URL (e.g. `/8a31ea9d-d00a-4e37-807b-a69624964ba0`).
