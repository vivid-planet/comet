# Grid and Form Layouts

These stories should be used as starting points when building admin interfaces to make sure the behavior and look is consistent throughout applications.

## Forms

Examples of small and large forms, used in pages directly and in dialogs.

### Simple form on a page

All fields of a form should be wrapped inside a `FieldSet`, unless the form is used inside a dialog or a sidebar. <br />
A title for a single `FieldSet` is not necessary.

<Canvas of={GridAndFormLayoutsStories.SimpleFormOnAPage} />

### Large form on a page

Use multiple `FieldSet` components for large forms to separate into multiple sections. <br />
It's recommended to set a title for each `FieldSet`.

<Canvas of={GridAndFormLayoutsStories.LargeFormOnAPage} />

### Simple form in a dialog

Do not use `FieldSet` for a form inside a dialog.

<Canvas of={GridAndFormLayoutsStories.SimpleFormInADialog} />

### Large form in a dialog

For large forms, use multiple `FormSection` components to create separation. <br />
Do not use `FieldSet` for a form inside a dialog.

<Canvas of={GridAndFormLayoutsStories.LargeFormInADialog} />

## Grids

Examples of `DataGrid` used on pages and some special use cases.

### Single Grid

If only the grid is used on the page, wrap it in a `StackMainContent` with `fullHeight`.

<Canvas of={GridAndFormLayoutsStories.SingleGridFullHeight} />

### Single Grid (Auto Height)

If you are sure that there will always only be very few items in the grid, you can use `autoHeight` on the `DataGrid` and skip the `fullHeight` prop on `StackMainContent`

<Canvas of={GridAndFormLayoutsStories.SingleGridAutoHeight} />

### Grid selection with more actions menu
