# useStoredState()

The `useStoredState()` hook has a similar api like the `React.useState()` hook. The main difference is, that `useStoredState()` saves and loads the state by default to local storage, so the state is persistent over tabs, and browser restarts.

### Local Storage

<Canvas>
    <Story of={UseStoredStateStories.LocalStorage} />
</Canvas>

### Session Storage

There is also the possibility to store the state in session storage by setting the kind of storage (`window.localStorage` or `window.sessionStorage`) after the initial state. The session storage is not persistent over tabs and lasts only for the current session.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={UseStoredStateStories.SessionStorage} />
</Canvas>
