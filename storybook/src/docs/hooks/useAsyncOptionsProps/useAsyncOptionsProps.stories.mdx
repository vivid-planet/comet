# useAsyncOptionsProps()

The `useAsyncOptionsProps()` can be used in FinalFormSelect and FinalFormAutocomplete to provide the same API for async loading options. Using the hook simply consists of loading the options in a form of an array of objects.

The shape of the object (in the examples: `interface Option`) can vary and determines the value of the field. This means that the value of the field also has to be loaded as an object of the same shape. To avoid referential equality for the current value and the option the prop `getOptionSelected` should be overwritten.
