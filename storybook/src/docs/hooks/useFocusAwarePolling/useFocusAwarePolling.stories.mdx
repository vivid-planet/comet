# useFocusAwarePolling()

The `useFocusAwarePolling` hook prevents a `useQuery` hook from polling when the current browser tab is not in focus.
Polling will resume once the tab is back in focus.
Additionally, the query will be updated immediately on focus using `refetch`.

## Basic example

</Canvas>

### Query with `skip` option

When using the `useQuery` hook with the `skip` option enabled (for instance, to pause polling when a dialog is not open), add the `skip` option to `useFocusAwarePolling`.

    <Story id="stories-hooks-usefocusawarepolling--with-skip-option" />
