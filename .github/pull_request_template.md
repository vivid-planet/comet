## Description

<!--

The description should describe the change you're making.
It will be used as the commit message for the squashed commit once the PR is merged.

PLEASE DESCRIBE WHY YOU'RE MAKING THE CHANGE, NOT WHAT YOU'RE CHANGING.
Reviewers see what you're changing when reviewing the code.
However, they might not understand your motives as to why you're making the change.

Your description should include:
-   The problem you're facing
-   Your solution to the problem
-   An example usage of your change

--->

<!--

Everything below this is intended to help ease reviewing this PR.
Remove all unrelated sections.

WHEN MERGING THE PR, REMOVE THIS FROM THE COMMIT MESSAGE.

## Example

<!--

Make sure to provide an example of your change if your change includes a new API.

This can be either:
-   The implementation in Demo
-   A dev story in Storybook
-   A unit test

[] I have verified if my change requires an example

## Screenshots/screencasts

<!--

When making a visual change, please provide either screenshots or screencasts.

Hint: For before/after views, you can use a table:

| Before   | After   |
| -------- | ------- |
| Link     | Link    |

## Changeset

<!--

When making a notable change, make sure to add a changeset.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/vivid-planet/comet/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

TL;DR

Add a changeset when:
-   changing the package's public API (`src/index.ts`)
-   fixing a bug
-   making a visual change

Changeset writing guidelines:
-   Use active voice: "Add new thing" vs. "A new thing is added"
-   First line should be the title: "Add new alert component"
-   Provide additional information in the description
-   Use backticks to highlight code: Add new `Alert` component
-   Use bold formatting for "headlines": **Example**
