title: Coding Guidelines
---

## Scope

These coding best practices were primarily developed for Comet projects. However, many of the principles are generally applicable.

## Goals

We aim to establish a common baseline that everyone can largely agree with. The coding best practices should be continuously improved with input from all team members. The following pages are intended to serve as a foundation for code reviews.

## Non-Goals

Strict 100% compliance at all times is not a goal. Exceptions are acceptable when they are well-justified. Full consensus on every point from everyone is also not required.

## Principles

We generally agree on certain principles and paradigms, such as [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).
