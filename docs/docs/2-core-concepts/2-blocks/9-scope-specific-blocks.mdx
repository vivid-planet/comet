title: Scope-specific blocks
---

Certain blocks may only be available in specific content scopes.
For instance, a special teaser block may only be available for a specific customer.
Scope-specific blocks can be achieved by using the `supportsBlock` option of the `BlocksConfigProvider`:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { BlocksConfigProvider } from "@comet/cms-admin";

export function App() {
    return (
        <BlocksConfigProvider
            supportsBlock={(name, scope) => {
                if (scope.domain === "specific-customer") {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    // Note: this is the block name defined in the BlockInterface
                    return name !== "MySpecialTeaser";
                }
            }}
        >
            {/* Other providers... */}
        </BlocksConfigProvider>
    );
}
```

The `supportsBlock` function receives the block name and the current scope as arguments.
It should return `true` if the block is supported in the current content scope and `false` otherwise.
An unsupported block will not be available in the BlocksBlock and OneOfBlock.

:::danger

This feature is Admin-only, so creating documents with unsupported blocks is still possible in the API.
