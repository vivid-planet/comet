title: Content Visibility
---

COMET DXP has a built-in content visibility system that controls which content is served to different consumers. Pages in the page tree have a **visibility state**, and individual blocks inside documents can be toggled **visible or invisible**. The API uses the `x-include-invisible-content` HTTP header to decide what content to include in responses.

## Page Tree Node Visibility

Every page tree node has a visibility state, which is one of:

| State           | Description                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Published**   | The page is live and visible to site visitors.                              |
| **Unpublished** | The page is not yet ready for visitors. Only visible in the admin and preview. |
| **Archived**    | The page has been retired. Only visible in the admin and preview.           |

New pages default to **Unpublished**. Editors can change the visibility state in the admin UI through the page tree context menu.

The home page cannot be set to Unpublished or Archived.

## Block Visibility

Blocks created with `createBlocksBlock` (the standard list-of-blocks factory) support a per-block **visible** toggle. When a block is marked invisible, it is hidden from site visitors but still visible to editors in the admin UI.

This lets editors prepare content ahead of time or temporarily hide a block without deleting it.

The "Show only visible blocks" toggle in the [block preview menu bar](/docs/features-modules/preview#menuBarButtons) lets editors switch between viewing all blocks and viewing only visible blocks.

## The `x-include-invisible-content` Header

The `x-include-invisible-content` HTTP header tells the API which invisible content to include in its response. It accepts a comma-separated list of entries:

| Entry               | Effect                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Pages:Unpublished` | Include page tree nodes with visibility state "Unpublished" |
| `Pages:Archived`    | Include page tree nodes with visibility state "Archived"    |
| `Blocks:Invisible`  | Include blocks that are marked as invisible                 |

**Example:**

```
x-include-invisible-content: Pages:Unpublished,Pages:Archived,Blocks:Invisible
```

When the header is **absent**, only published pages and visible blocks are returned — this is the default behavior for the public site.

:::warning

Legacy values (`Unpublished`, `Archived` without the `Pages:` prefix) are still supported but deprecated. They will log a warning and should be migrated to the new format.

### Authentication Requirement

When the `x-include-invisible-content` header is present, the API **requires authentication** — even on endpoints that would normally be public (decorated with `@DisableCometGuards()`). This ensures that invisible content is never accidentally exposed to unauthenticated users.

## How Each Layer Uses the Header

### Admin

The admin UI **always** sends the full header on every request so that editors can see all content regardless of its visibility state:

```typescript
const headers = {
    "x-include-invisible-content": "Pages:Unpublished,Pages:Archived,Blocks:Invisible",
};
```

This is configured automatically by the built-in Apollo link (`includeInvisibleContentContext`) and the HTTP client.

### Site (Public)

The public site does **not** send the header. All API requests return only published pages and visible blocks — no additional configuration is needed.

### Site Preview

The site preview mode allows editors to see content that is not yet live. The admin generates a signed JWT containing preview parameters, which the site converts into the appropriate header values.

**Unpublished pages are always included in preview mode.** Whenever preview data is present (i.e., the site is in draft/preview mode), `Pages:Unpublished` is sent unconditionally. This ensures editors can always navigate to and preview unpublished pages without any extra configuration.

The **visibility toggle** ("Show only visible") in the `SitePreview` component controls **only block visibility**. When the toggle is off (showing all content), `Blocks:Invisible` is added to the header so that hidden blocks are also rendered in the preview. When the toggle is on, only visible blocks are shown — but unpublished pages remain accessible.

```typescript
// From @comet/site-react — convertPreviewDataToHeaders
const includeInvisiblePages = !!previewData; // Always true when in preview mode
const includeInvisibleBlocks = previewData && previewData.includeInvisible; // Controlled by the toggle
```

## Using the Header in Custom Resolvers

If you write custom GraphQL resolvers that query the page tree, use the `@RequestContext()` decorator to respect the header:

```typescript title="my-custom.resolver.ts"
import { RequestContext, RequestContextInterface } from "@comet/cms-api";
import { PageTreeNodeVisibility, PageTreeService } from "@comet/cms-api";

@Resolver(() => MyEntity)
export class MyCustomResolver {
    constructor(private readonly pageTreeService: PageTreeService) {}

    @Query(() => MyEntity)
    async myEntity(
        @Args("pageTreeNodeId") pageTreeNodeId: string,
        @RequestContext() { includeInvisiblePages }: RequestContextInterface,
    ): Promise<MyEntity> {
        const node = await this.pageTreeService
            .createReadApi({
                visibility: [
                    PageTreeNodeVisibility.Published,
                    ...(includeInvisiblePages ?? []),
                ],
            })
            .getNodeOrFail(pageTreeNodeId);

        // ... use the node
    }
}
```

This ensures your resolver returns only published pages for site visitors while showing all pages to authenticated admin users.

## How Block Visibility Works Internally

Block factories like `createBlocksBlock`, `createListBlock`, and `createOneOfBlock` check the `includeInvisibleContent` flag in the block context during transformation:

- **`createBlocksBlock`**: Each block in the list has a `visible` property. When `includeInvisibleContent` is `false`, invisible blocks return empty props, effectively hiding their content.
- **`createOneOfBlock`**: Inactive (non-selected) attached blocks are only included when `includeInvisibleContent` is `true`.
- **`createListBlock`** and **`createOptionalBlock`**: Follow the same pattern, filtering invisible items from the output.

The `BlocksTransformerService` reads the header and passes `includeInvisibleContent` through the `BlockContext` to all block transformations automatically.
