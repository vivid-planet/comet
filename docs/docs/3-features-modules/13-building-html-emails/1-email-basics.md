title: Email Basics
---

Email clients don't share a rendering engine the way web browsers do. The most constrained major client — Outlook on Windows (2007–2019) — uses Microsoft Word to render HTML, supporting only a fraction of modern CSS. While Outlook's global market share is small, it dominates in enterprise and B2B environments. This shapes every aspect of email development: table-based layouts (handled by MJML), inline styles for the base rendering, and responsive styles layered on top as progressive enhancement.

## MJML Fundamentals

[MJML](https://documentation.mjml.io/) is a markup language that compiles to cross-client-compatible HTML emails. `@comet/mail-react` exposes MJML tags as React components (e.g., `MjmlSection`, `MjmlText`, `MjmlColumn`) and adds a theme system and higher-level components on top. You write JSX, the library converts it to MJML, and MJML generates the final HTML.

MJML enforces a **section → column → content** nesting hierarchy. Content components (`MjmlText`, `MjmlImage`, `MjmlButton`, etc.) must always be placed inside `MjmlSection > MjmlColumn`. Placing them elsewhere produces MJML validation warnings and broken layouts. The MJML Warnings panel in Storybook surfaces these issues during development.

For a full reference of all available MJML tags and their attributes, see the [official MJML documentation](https://documentation.mjml.io/).

## The Styling Model

Email styling follows a desktop-first approach where all default styles must be applied inline — either through MJML component props (which compile to inline styles) or through explicit `style` attributes on raw HTML elements. This is because desktop email clients like Outlook (2007–2019) use Microsoft Word as their rendering engine and ignore `<style>` blocks entirely. The base rendering of every email must look correct with inline styles alone.

:::caution
Never rely on `<style>` blocks for your base/desktop layout. Outlook and several other major clients strip or ignore them. Always set default styles inline via MJML component props.

Media queries, registered via [`registerStyles`](./4-customization.md#registering-responsive-styles), serve as **progressive enhancement** for mobile and responsive behavior. Clients that support media queries also support modern CSS, so properties like `flex` and CSS custom properties are safe to use inside them. Because inline styles take precedence over `<style>` blocks, responsive overrides must use `!important` to take effect. See [Adding Custom Responsive Styles](./4-customization.md#adding-custom-responsive-styles) for details.

## MJML Components vs HTML Components

### Ending Tags

Some MJML components are [**ending tags**](https://documentation.mjml.io/#ending-tags) — they accept HTML content as children but **cannot** contain other MJML components. The most common ending tags are `mj-text`, `mj-button`, `mj-table`, and `mj-raw`.

Once you enter an ending tag, you are in **HTML-land for the entire subtree**. No MJML components can be used at any nesting depth within that subtree. Everything inside `MjmlText`, for example, is treated as raw HTML by the MJML engine. You can use HTML elements like `<span>`, `<a>`, `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>`, but you cannot nest another `MjmlText` or `MjmlSection` inside it.

When you need to drop into raw HTML outside of a text context — for example, to build a custom table layout — use `MjmlRaw` (or `MjmlTable` for table shorthand). These are escape hatches for cases where MJML components can't achieve the desired layout, and should generally be a last resort.

`@comet/mail-react` provides both MJML-level and HTML-level text components to work across this boundary. See [Components & Theme](./2-components-and-theme.md#text) for all available text components and their usage.

## Common Pitfalls

### Avoid Block-Level HTML Elements Inside Ending Tags

Don't use `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, or other block-level HTML elements inside ending tags. They have wildly inconsistent default margins and spacing across email clients and add no rendering value in email HTML. Instead, use `<td>`, `<div>`, and `<span>` for structure, and build your typography hierarchy through `MjmlText`/`HtmlText` [text variants](./2-components-and-theme.md#text-variants) rather than HTML semantics. If a block-level element is truly unavoidable, always reset its margins explicitly with inline styles (e.g., `style={{ margin: 0 }}`).

### Set `mso-line-height-rule: exactly` for Manual HTML

Outlook calculates line-height using its own rules, which can cause unexpected vertical spacing. When setting `line-height` on raw HTML elements inside ending tags, also set `mso-line-height-rule: exactly` as an inline style to force Outlook to respect your value. `HtmlText` and the built-in MJML components handle this automatically — this only applies to manually written HTML inside `MjmlRaw` or similar escape hatches.

### No CSS `background-image` in Outlook

Desktop Outlook ignores the CSS `background-image` property entirely. If your design uses background images, you need a [VML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/vml/web-workshop---specs---standards----introduction-to-vector-markup-language--vml-)-based workaround for Outlook support, or accept graceful degradation by always providing a `background-color` fallback. Campaign Monitor's [Bulletproof Background Images](https://www.backgrounds.cm/) generator can help produce the necessary VML markup.

### No CSS `border-radius` in Outlook

Desktop Outlook ignores CSS `border-radius` entirely — rounded corners on buttons, containers, or any other element will render as sharp rectangles. The standard workaround is [VML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/vml/web-workshop---specs---standards----introduction-to-vector-markup-language--vml-) (Vector Markup Language) wrapped in conditional comments (`<!--[if mso]>`): a `v:roundrect` element with an `arcsize` attribute provides rounded corners that Outlook's Word-based engine can render. Campaign Monitor's [Bulletproof Email Buttons](https://www.buttons.cm/) generator and the [Litmus VML button snippet](https://litmus.com/community/snippets/7-bulletproof-button-vml-approach) are good starting points for this technique.
