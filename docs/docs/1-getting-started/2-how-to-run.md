A COMET DXP application consists of multiple processes, such as:

- [an API](packages-tools#apiPackage)
- [an admin application](packages-tools#adminPackage)
- [a frontend site application](packages-tools#sitePackage)
- type generators

We recommend using a process manager to avoid starting all these processes manually. Luckily, the steps in the [installation section](creating-a-project#installation) automatically installed the package: [@vivid-planet/dev-process-manager](https://github.com/vivid-planet/dev-process-manager).

Executing the following command starts all processes required to run a [COMET DXP application](application-structure):

`npm run dev`

## That's it!

Your COMET DXP application is up and running.

- Execute `npm run browser` to display your application in the browser
- Adding a custom process can be done in the file: _ecosystem.config.js_
