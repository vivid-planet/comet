COMET DXP is a highly customizable platform for building modern applications based on a headless CMS.

The following design principles are considered:

-   [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
-   Cloud-Native ([foundation/charter.md at main Â· cncf/foundation](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation))
-   Microservices ([What are microservices?](https://microservices.io/))
-   Headless ([Headless content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system))
-   Infrastructure as Code ([What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac))
-   Mobile first
-   Typescript everywhere

The following diagram visually highlights these principles.

**Why don't just use an off-the-shelf solution?**

-   We want a solution that is highly customizable
-   We want to offer excellent developer experience (DX)
-   We want to host on-premise
