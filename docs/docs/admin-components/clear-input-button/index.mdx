# ClearInputButton

The ClearInputButton is a Button which is used inside a clearable Input Field. It can be used inside an InputAdornment of an InputField.
The ClearInputButton extends the props from the [Material UI ButtonBase](https://mui.com/api/button-base/) component with the `icon` prop.
It lets you specify which ClearIcon you want to display.
