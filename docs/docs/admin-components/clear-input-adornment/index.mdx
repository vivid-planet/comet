# ClearInputAdornment

`ClearInputAdornment` adds a button to clear the value of an input field.<br />
It is based on and therefore used the same way as [MuiInputAdornment](https://mui.com/api/input-adornment/).

## Existing `clearable` prop

Many components in Comet Admin already implement the ClearInputAdornment. It can be enabled with the `clearable` prop.
