Comet Admin components are designed to be used similarly to MUI components.
The APIs for styling, theming, overriding props, and replacing icons are similar to MUI.

Following are examples of customizing the `ContentOverflow` component.
The examples should all be transferable to other components.

For instructions on how to build components that support these features, see [Creating customizable Admin components](/docs/comet-core-development/creating-customizable-admin-components).

## Commonly used term: Slot

A component is made up of HTML elements and other components.
Each of these elements or components is referred to as a slot.
Each of the component's slots can be accessed through its name to override styles and props.
The outermost slot of a component is generally called `root`.

## Customizing individual instances of a component

### Styling a component's root slot

Overriding the styles of the root slot can be done using the `sx` prop.  
See [MUIs `sx` documentation](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) for more details.

```tsx
<ContentOverflow sx={{ backgroundColor: "lime" }}>{/* ... */}</ContentOverflow>
```

### Overriding the props of a slot

The props of a slot can be accessed using the `slotProps` prop.
In this case, we have a slot named `clickableContent`, a component based on MUI's `ButtonBase`.
We can disable the button by setting the `disabled` prop to `true` on the slot.

```tsx
<ContentOverflow
    slotProps={{
        clickableContent: {
            disabled: true,
        },
    }}
>
    {/* ... */}
</ContentOverflow>
```

### Styling a slot

Overriding the styles of a component's slot can be done by accessing its `sx` prop through the `slotProps` prop.
In this case, we have a slot named `openDialogIcon`, which is a `div` that wraps an icon.
Since the icon's size and color are inherited from the parent, we can override them by setting the styles in the slot's `sx` prop.

```tsx
<ContentOverflow
    slotProps={{
        openDialogIcon: {
            sx: {
                fontSize: 40,
                color: "fuchsia",
            },
        },
    }}
>
    {/* ... */}
</ContentOverflow>
```

## Customizing components globally

### Overriding styles of a component

Overriding the styles of a component can be done in the theme using the component's `styleOverrides`.
In this case, we override the background of the `root` slot and the font styles of the `openDialogIcon` slot.

```ts
const theme = createCometTheme({
    components: {
        CometAdminContentOverflow: {
            styleOverrides: {
                root: {
                    backgroundColor: "lime",
                },
                openDialogIcon: {
                    fontSize: 40,
                    color: "fuchsia",
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```

### Setting default props of a component

Overriding the default props of a component can be done in the theme using the component's `defaultProps`.
In this case, we replace the `openDialog` icon using the `iconMapping` prop.

```ts
const theme = createCometTheme({
    components: {
        CometAdminContentOverflow: {
            defaultProps: {
                iconMapping: {
                    openDialog: <Preview fontSize="large" />,
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```
