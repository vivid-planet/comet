# Button

This is an example description for the button component. It's used to test the documentation generation.

This is a second paragraph, with a link to the normal [Button](./Button) component. <br/>
And this is a nother line in the same paragraph.

<PrimaryStoryIframe componentName="button" />

## All variants

<StoryIframe componentName="button" storyName="AllVariants" />

## Responsive behavior

When using the button in a place where the width can be constrained, such as in a toolbar on a mobile device, you can set the `responsive`.

This causes the text-content to be hidden on smaller devices and be moved to a tooltip instead.
The button will only show an icon then by default.
This requires either a `startIcon` or `endIcon` to be set, or the `mobileIcon` which is used specifically for this purpose.
The breakpoint at which the button will be responsive can be set using the `mobileBreakpoint` prop.

<StoryIframe componentName="button" storyName="ResponsiveBehavior" />
