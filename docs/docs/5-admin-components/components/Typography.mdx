import { Story } from "../../../src/components/Story";

# Typography

Use the [Typography](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/) component provided by MUI.

## Custom variants

The theme from `@comet/admin` defines two custom `Typography` variants:

- `list`
- `listItem`

You can use them to display lists in continuous text:

<Story path="Typography" />
