import { Story } from "../../../src/components/Story";

# Typography

Use the [Typography](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/) component provided by MUI.

## Custom variants

`@comet/admin-theme` defines two custom `Typography` variants:

- `list`
- `listItem`

You can use them to display lists in continuous text:

<Story path="Typography" />

### TypeScript

You must tell TypeScript to include the type overrides defined in `@comet/admin-theme`.
Otherwise, you will get a type error when trying to use the custom variants.
You can do that by adding the following snippet to your `src/vendors.d.ts` file:

```ts
/// <reference types="@comet/admin-theme" />
```
