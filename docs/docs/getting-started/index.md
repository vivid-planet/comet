In this section, you will learn everything you need to create, install and run your application.

Feel free to dive into the [beginner tutorial](http://localhost:3000/docs/getting-started/beginner-tutorial/) where you will be building a section of a webpage.

We recommend that you also take a look at the following documentation, as a COMET DXP application makes intensive use of it:

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
-   [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
