## Styling blocks

Now we will be styling our new custom block!
To do that, we are using the package [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs).

<!-- Where will we be styling
We create the styled components in our block file that is in the site directory. If we will be adding a lot of styles and the file would become too long, we can auslager the styles into a separate *.sc.tsx file which is imported in our block file. -->
