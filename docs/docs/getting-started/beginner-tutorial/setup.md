# Setup Requirements 

:::warning

COMET DXP is only compatible with Unix systems. If you are on **Windows**, it is recommended to follow these steps on [WSL with a Ubuntu distribution](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview).

:::

You will need:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installation (Docker must be running!)
-   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) installation (best with [Deeper Shell Integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration)) <!-- Link zu automatischem Versionswechsel -->
