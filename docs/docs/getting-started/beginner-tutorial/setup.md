:::warning

COMET DXP is only compatible with Unix systems. If you are on **Windows**, it is recommended to follow these steps on [WSL with a Ubuntu distribution](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview).

You will need:
- Docker installation (Docker must be running!)
