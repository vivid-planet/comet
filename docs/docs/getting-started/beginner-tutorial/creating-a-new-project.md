Let's create a new COMET project first!

1. Run the following command in your terminal to create a new COMET DXP application:

`npx @comet/create-app my-first-comet-app`

2. Run the install script in the root directory of your application:

`./install.sh`

3. Execute the following command to run your application:

`npm run dev`

4. Run the following command to open your application in your browser:

`npm run browser`

There should be 3 windows open in your browser now:

-   the **API** playground
-   the **admin** on `localhost:8000`
-   the **site** on `localhost:3000`
