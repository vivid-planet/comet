Support wildcard values for content scope dimensions in `getContentScopesForUser`

`getContentScopesForUser` can now return `UserPermissions.allValues` as the value of a content scope dimension to grant access to any value for that dimension. The wildcard is matched during the content scope check, so it does not need to be part of `availableContentScopes`.

**Example**

```ts
getContentScopesForUser(user: User): ContentScopesForUser {
    // Grant access to every language within the "main" domain
    return [{ domain: "main", language: UserPermissions.allValues }];
}
```
