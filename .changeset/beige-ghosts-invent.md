Improve the `SaveConflictDialog`

- extend the text in the dialog to explain
  - what happened
  - what the next steps are
  - what can be done to avoid conflicts
- make the button labels more precise
- once the save dialog is closed
  - stop polling
  - mark the save button red and with an error icon
