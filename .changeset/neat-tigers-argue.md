Add loading spinner to `IFrameViewer`

This feature was added to inform users that the iframe is loading. It is particularly useful when loading takes a long time due to a slow network connection or a large amount of content or data. The feedback remains visible until the iframe is fully loaded and the `onLoad` event is triggered.
