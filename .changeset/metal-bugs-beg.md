Add the ability to show and hide individual `DataGrid` columns depending on the screen size using the `useDynamicGridVisibilityModel` hook

A simple usage example would be having a `DataGrid` that shows separate `firstName` and `lastName` columns on desktop and a single `fullName` column on mobile instead.
