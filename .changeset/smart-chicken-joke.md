Adapt `SaveBoundarySaveButton` to look like the standard `FeedbackButton` and match the Comet DXP design

The following props have been removed, as the component's state is handled internally and the icons are no longer used: `saving`, `hasErrors`, `hasConflict`, `savingItem`, `successItem`, `errorItem`, `conflictItem`, `saveIcon`, `savingIcon`, `successIcon`, `errorIcon`, `conflictIcon`.
